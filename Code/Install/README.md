Use at your own risk, this is a basic script written by Matt to install Docker-Engine on a linux based machine. This will only work on Ubuntu and Redhat based systems. (Sorry Arch and... SUSE? users probably going to be paranoid and add those in later... but I don't know if this one will be updated)
